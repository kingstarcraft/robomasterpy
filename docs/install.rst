Install Dependencies First
---------------------------------------

If you are using Python 3.6.x, you need to install ``dataclasses``, which is already included in Python 3.7 and better::

    pip install dataclasses

Install OpenCV of your flavor, suggestion::

    # if you are using conda
    conda install -c conda-forge opencv

    # if you are using pip only
    pip install opencv-contrib-python

Install RoboMasterPy

    pip install robomasterpy

And you are good to go!
